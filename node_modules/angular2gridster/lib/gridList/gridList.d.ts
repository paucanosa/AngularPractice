/**
 * A GridList manages the two-dimensional positions from a list of items,
 * within a virtual matrix.
 *
 * The GridList's main function is to convert the item positions from one
 * grid size to another, maintaining as much of their order as possible.
 *
 * The GridList's second function is to handle collisions when moving an item
 * over another.
 *
 * The positioning algorithm places items in columns. Starting from left to
 * right, going through each column top to bottom.
 *
 * The size of an item is expressed using the number of cols and rows it
 * takes up within the grid (w and h)
 *
 * The position of an item is express using the col and row position within
 * the grid (x and y)
 *
 * An item is an object of structure:
 * {
 *   w: 3, h: 1,
 *   x: 0, y: 1
 * }
